//STRING IN JAVA

//In Java we can also use strings, in fact there is no primitive type "string" in Java,  
//strings in Java are an address to a memory space that stores a set characters. 


public class StringInJava {

    public static void main(String[] args){

        //See, strings always be written with double quotes, and the word "string" starts with a capital letter
        String word = "word";
        System.out.println(word); // => word

    }

}
